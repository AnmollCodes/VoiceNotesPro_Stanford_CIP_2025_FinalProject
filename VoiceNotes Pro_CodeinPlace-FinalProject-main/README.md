# Read Aloud — Stanford Code in Place 2025 — Final Project

VoiceNotes Pro is a Python program that helps users easily make audiobooks (Text-to-Speech MP3 files) from PDFs, while giving them the option to read along with the audiobook via the PDF viewer. This was my final project for Stanford Code in Place 2025, an introductory course to programming in Python.
